      <title>My Mac Apps List</title>

      <description>This list contains mac apps that I actually find useful. A lot of them are free + open-source alternatives that work just as well as their paid counterparts. I tried to limit the # of electron based apps since my machine (Base MBP 2015) canâ€™t really run them well.
They are in no particular order; I will clean up the presentation by adding a description of what they do, a link for where to get it, and maybe sections to group them by category or cost.</description>

      <description>Hi, this is one of my first projects that I&amp;rsquo;m comfortable with sharing. Similar to stickers on iMessage, this app allows you to create stickers from screenshots or existing images on the fly.
It&amp;rsquo;s pretty self explanatory, but there are 3 main components: a sticker manager, editor, and popover. You can edit and view your sticker collections in the manager, cut-out stickers from screen captures using the editor, and easily insert images into any textfield.</description>
