A lot of them are free + open-source alternatives that work just as well as their paid counterparts. I tried to limit the # of electron based apps since my machine (Base MBP 2015) can’t really run them well.
They are in no particular order; I will clean up the presentation by adding a description of what they do, a link for where to get it, and maybe sections to group them by category or cost.</description></item><item><title>Sticker Manager for macOS</title><link>/stickers-for-macos/</link><pubDate>Wed, 16 Dec 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/stickers-for-macos/</guid><description>Hi, this is one of my first projects that I&amp;rsquo;m comfortable with sharing. Similar to stickers on iMessage, this app allows you to create stickers from screenshots or existing images on the fly.
It&amp;rsquo;s pretty self explanatory, but there are 3 main components: a sticker manager, editor, and popover. You can edit and view your sticker collections in the manager, cut-out stickers from screen captures using the editor, and easily insert images into any textfield.</description></item></channel></rss>
