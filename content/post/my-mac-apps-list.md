This list contains mac apps that I actually find useful. A lot of them are free + open-source alternatives that work just as well as their paid counterparts. I tried to limit the # of electron based apps since my machine (Base MBP 2015) canâ€™t really run them well.

They are in no particular order; I will clean up the presentation by adding a description of what they do, a link for where to get it, and maybe sections to group them by category or cost. Will update soon.
