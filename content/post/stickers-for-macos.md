Hi, this is one of my first projects that I'm comfortable with sharing. Similar to stickers on iMessage, this app allows you to create stickers from screenshots or existing images on the fly.

It's pretty self explanatory, but there are 3 main components: a sticker manager, editor, and popover. You can edit and view your sticker collections in the manager, cut-out stickers from screen captures using the editor, and easily insert images into any textfield.

Future directions: create a unified marketplace (in the form of a web app) of stickers that can be downloaded easily, continue to optimize the application.

It is [open-source](https://github.com/tmprk/Stickers-macOS)! The code might not be the best, and there is still a long way to go, but I thought I'd share. Here are some screenshots and a demo ☺️:
