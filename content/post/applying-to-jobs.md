I’ve recently started applying to jobs and it is still super difficult even with all of these job boards and services to streamline our application process.

Starting from early December, I have applied to around 30-40 and have only received 1 interview for a job and had another application passed onto the hiring manager. Was super hyped because this was the first time this happened to me 😭 These are not at all good results, but I wasn’t expecting any different.

This time around, I have actually received rejections, which is a great relief because I had previously not gotten any feedback whatsoever from potential employers. Getting any sort of feedback makes the process much more motivating and worthwhile, compared to getting “ghosted” every time 😡.

Here are some things I’m figuring out about this process, and they might not all be true so correct me if I’m wrong!:

-   It seems like Indeed and other job boards do not have good response rates, so only use it to view open positions and then apply on the company site directly. “Easy Apply” or “One-click” might seem appealing but doesn’t provide a chance to explain yourself.
-   LinkedIn is actually a great source of high-quality jobs but can be much more competitive depending on what industry you’re looking at.
-   Angelist is a great resource if you’re looking to work at early startups.
-   Always sort by “Date Posted”. Chances are you will not hear back from a listing that was posted 30+ days ago, as the position may have already been filled.
-   Remove bloat from your resume. For example, delete your interests from your resume. The recruiter probably doesn’t care if you like cooking or not. Create more space for more relevant things.
-   Remove bloat from your cover letter. You don’t need to end your cover letter with “Thank you for your time, I hope to hear back from you“. It’s obvious that you want the position. Cut to the main point: your marketable skills and samples from your resume that highlight your candidacy for the position. The recruiter most likely will not be able to read all paragraphs, so bullet-point the parts you want to highlight first and then proceed with your background information. **“To save you time, I have researched this position so I can highlight relevant portions of my resume” (Source: Reddit r/jobs?)**. It might not actually be proven to be effective, but it seems healthy to change things up a bit.
-   Create specific resumes and cover letters for each company. This is probably the most annoying thing, but it seems to be the best practice for quality results. Just keep a folder of 5-6 different variations of cover letters depending on the job (iOS, Web, User Research, Product Design, UI, etc).
-   Never stop applying. Work will always be there, but the time to improve yourself will not. In the meantime, you can improve your skillsets while you apply. Get a license/certification that employers prefer. Or build out more side-projects to demonstrate your fitness for the job. Personally, my projects are lacking in complexity and real-world applications and that is something I have to work on too :)

Moving forward, I’m aiming to send at least 3-5 thoughtful job applications per day in hopes of getting a job before I graduate. Hopefully there is someone out there willing to give me a chance in the work field.
